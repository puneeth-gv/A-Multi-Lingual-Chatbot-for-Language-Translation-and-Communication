# A Multi Lingual Chatbot for Language Translation and Communication
This project is a multi-language voice assistant that can perform various functions such as web searches and language translation. The program uses Python and several libraries to enable speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and audio playback.

## Libraries Used
The program uses the following Python libraries:

**speech_recognition:** To listen to audio input from a microphone and convert it into text using the Google speech recognition engine.

**pyttsx3:** To convert the translated text into speech using the text-to-speech (TTS) module.

**pywhatkit:** To perform web searches and other functions.

**playsound:** To play back the translated speech through the computer's speakers.

## Features
The voice assistant can understand speech in different languages and respond with spoken words in the same language. The program detects specific words or phrases to identify the user's language preference and respond accordingly. It can also translate the language into Braj Bhasha, a dialect of Hindi, by replacing certain words in the translated text.

## Getting Started
To get started with the program, clone this repository and install the required libraries using pip. Then, run the 'main.py' file to start the voice assistant.

```
git clone https://github.com/puneeth-gv/A-Multi-Lingual-Chatbot-for-Language-Translation-and-Communication.git
cd A-Multi-Lingual-Chatbot-for-Language-Translation-and-Communication
pip install -r requirements.txt
